# React + Vite

Setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

# Useful commands:

Move with the terminal where the code is 'src':
```
npm i
npm i @types/node -D
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
```
## Test the build

First time install
```
npm install -g serve
```
Move to build directory (usually 'dist') with the terminal. Launch:
```
serve
```

# After build

Rename 'dist' directory to 'docs'.

Add '/purple-website' to the 2 paths in the index (add to images to if you removed before)
